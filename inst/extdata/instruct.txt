validate count matrix

-> count matrix must be a tibble, data frame or a character string denoting a count file
-> count matrix must contain a column containing unique identifier for each row. Usually this is Geneid
-> if a file provided, column names are mendatory

// Ideally there should be a function to validate count matrix and sample information.

why do an argument column_samples required ?

Count output from a featureCount contains columns such as chr, start, end, strand etc.
To use this file directly as an input, it is mendatory to ask user to provide which are count columns.

Decide on which samples to use for DESeq analysis ?

-> all samples given under 'column_samples' must present in 'count'
-> all samples given in first column of 'sample_info' must present in 'count'
-> for DESeq analysis the samples which are present in 'sample_info' will only be used.
-> What if samples given on 'column_samples' not present in first column of 'sample_info' ? Have you checked this ?


// TO DO
 Think of genrating automated R markdown reports for whole RNAseq data analysis.

 -> fix the function to generate run commnands to add import lines in description file.
