validate count matrix

-> count matrix must be a tibble, data frame or a character string denting a count file
-> count matrix must contain a column containing unique identifier for each row. Usually this is Geneid
-> if a file provided, column names are mendatory


why do an argument column_samples required ?

Count output from a featureCount contains columns such as chr, start, end, strand etc.
To use this file directly as an input, it is mendatory to ask user to provide count columns.


Decide on which samples to use for DESeq analysis ?

-> all samples given under 'column_samples' must present in 'count'
-> all samples given in first column of 'sample_info' must present in 'count'
-> for DESeq analysis the samples which are present in 'sample_info' will only be used.
